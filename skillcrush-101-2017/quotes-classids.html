    <h1>Some Super Awesome Feminist Quotes</h1>

    <p class="Malala-quote">"We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back."
       - Malala Yousafzai</p>
    <p class="Audre-quote">"I am not free while any woman is unfree, even when
      her shackles are very different from my own." - Audre Lorde</p>
    <p id="favorite-quote">"Here's to strong women. May we know them. May we be
      them. May we raise them." - Unknown</p>
    <p class="Amy-quote">"I am a woman with thoughts and questions and sh*t to
