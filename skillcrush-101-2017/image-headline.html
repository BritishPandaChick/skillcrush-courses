    <h1>Emma</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and
      happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of
      existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very
      little to distress or vex her.</p>
