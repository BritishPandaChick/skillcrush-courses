    <h1><strong>A Coffin &mdash; is a Small Domain</strong></h1>
    <p>A Coffin &mdash; is a small Domain,<br>Yet able to contain<br>A Citizen of
      Paradise<br>In it diminished Plane.</p>

    <p>A Grav &mdash; is a restricted Breadth &mdash;<br>Yet ampler than the Sun
      &mdash;<br>And all the Seas He populates<br>And Lands He looks upon</p>

    <p>To Him who on its small Repose<br>Bestows a single Friend &mdash;<br>Circumference w
      ithout Relief &mdash; <br>Or Estimate &mdash; or End &mdash;</p>
