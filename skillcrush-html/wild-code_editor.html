		<h2>About Me</h2>
	</header>

	<p>My name is Sarah. I was born in South Korea, but I was brought to the United States and have lived here ever since. I am a huge fan of the show Once Upon a Time and am dedicating several posts to the show.</p>
	
	<h3>Show Plot</h3>
		<p>There is a fictional town in Maine called Storybrooke. Storybrooke may seem like a regular town, but there is more to this town that meets the eye. All the residents from this town come from a magical land called the Enchanted Forest. The residents don't have any memory of this land or their lives in that land. 28 years ago, the evil queen Regina cast a dark curse which brought everyone from the Enchanted Forest to our world, a place without magic and any happily ever afters. Here the evil queen was able to be victorious while everyone else had fake memories while time stood still.<p>
		<p>Now hope wasn't lost. Snow White and Prince Charming went to see the Dark One and all powerful Rumplestiltskin. Rumplestiltskin warned Snow and Charming about the curse as well as revealing the only thing they could do to stop Regina. Snow and Charming's child Emma would be the savior who would restore all the happy endings and challenge the evil queen as long as she was gotten to safety. So Geppetto carved a magical wardrobe from a magical tree in hopes Snow White and her child would make it to safety until Emma's 28th birthday where her destiny would begin. However Emma arrived early and her parents decided to send the baby alone through the magical wardrobe.<p>
		<p>28 years later, Emma is now a bails bond woman who had a rough childhood. On Emma's 28th birthday, she receives a visit from Henry, her son she gave up for adopted when she was 18. Henry begs Emma to return home with him to his home in Storybrooke. So Emma starts her destiny filled with dragons, magic, and adventure.</p>
	
	<h4>New Characters for Season 5</h4>
		<p>Biggest additions are Sean Maguire and Rebecca Mader as series regular. These two have been recurring characters on the show, but their additions to the show means these two will be given more action throughout the story. Robin Hood especially is a good fit since they are going to Camelot this time. I always liked the wicked witch as a villain and it will be great seing her terrorizing Oz and Storybrooke again. Other new characters include some of the beloved characters from the Camelot legends. Lancelot is once again returning for flashblacks and more since he appeared in season 2. Fans can expect to see King Arthur, his queen, and all his knights. However the biggest suprise came at Comic Con this year when Merida was announced. Merida is going to have a big role during the Camelot story lines so it will be great to see what is in store for this character.</p>
