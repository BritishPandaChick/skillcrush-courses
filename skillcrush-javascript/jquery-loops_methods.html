    <h3>Eat Simply</h3>
    <p>Instead of being overly concerned with counting calories or measuring
      portion sizes, think of your diet in terms of color, variety, and freshness.
      This way it should be easier to make healthy choices.</p>
    <p>Focus on finding foods you love and easy recipes that incorporate a few
      fresh ingredients. Gradually, your diet will become healthier and more
      delicious.</p>
    <h3>Make Changes Slowly</h3>
    <p>Trying to make your diet healthy overnight isn't realistic or smart. Changing
      everything at once usually leads to cheating or giving up on your new eating
      plan. Make small steps, like adding a salad (full of different color vegetables)
      to your diet once a day or switching from butter to olive oil when cooking.</p>
    <p>As yours small changes become habit, you can continue to add more healthy
      choices to your diet.</p>
