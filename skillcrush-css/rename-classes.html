<p class="kitchen-sink">Kitchen sink no longer available!</p>

<p class="please-advise">Please be advised: the kitchen sink on the ground floor has been rendered inoperable due to an excessive clog of unknown proportion and magnitude. Please refrain from using, filling, or otherwise looking at the kitchen sink. If you absolutely require the use of a sink, you may explore the existence of alternate sinks located elsewhere on the premises: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Scullery or butler's pantry on the ground floor</li>
    <li>Silver polishing room on the second floor</li>
    <li>Water closets on the third and fifth floors</li>
    <li>Wine cellar</li>
    <li>Chocolate room, accessible through the bookcase in the billiard room</li>
</ul>

<p class="dungeon-notice">If you fail to regard this notice, you may be required to spend the night in the dungeons.</p>
